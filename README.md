# Projects

The following projects highlight my hands-on experience in modernizing infrastructure and streamlining CI/CD workflows in cloud environments. From leading a full-scale migration to enabling long-term DevOps transformation across teams, each initiative reflects a commitment to scalability, automation, and operational efficiency. These case studies showcase not only technical execution but also strategic planning, cost optimization, and cross-team enablementâ€”key elements in delivering robust, future-ready solutions.
