# Project: DevOps Modernization

## Summary

This project focused on modernizing the infrastructure as well as introducing modern DevOps philosophy by transitioning from legacy systems to a scalable, cloud-native solutions and implementing robust processes. The primary objective was to enhance the software development life cycle (SDLC) by migrating CI/CD pipelines from legacy on-premise environments (OneNeck and Rackspace) to GitHub Actions and AWS.

## Key Responsibilities and Achievements

- **Legacy Migration**: Participated in the phased migration from legacy Jenkins CI/CD and infrastructure hosted on OneNeck and Rackspace to a cloud-based architecture using GitHub Actions and AWS services.
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Reviewed existing CI/CD pipelines, identified quick-win improvements, and recommended sustainable enhancements to improve reliability and speed.
- **Cross-Team Enablement**: Provided expert guidance across multiple engineering teams, helping them maximize effectiveness and adopt best practices in DevOps.
- **Architecture Design**: Supported the design and implementation of future-state CI/CD workflows in GitHub Actions tailored for both Site and Server Technology applications.
- **System Simplification**: Contributed to building reusable, modular components ("LEGO-like bricks") to simplify workflow creation and reduce system complexity.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitated a deeper understanding of system architecture through documentation such as workflow diagrams, helping onboard and upskill internal teams.

## Outcome

The project enabled client to accelerate the decommissioning of outdated infrastructure, reduce complexity in the CI/CD ecosystem, and move toward a robust, scalable cloud environment that supports long-term engineering and business objectives.
