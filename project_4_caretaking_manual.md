# Project: IT Resources Usage Policy

_Caretaking Manual for Contractors and Employees_

This manual was developed as a practical extension of our broader IT infrastructure and DevOps transformation initiatives. While our projects focus on scaling cloud-native systems and automating workflows, this guide addresses the human layer—how we as professionals interact with the tools, hardware, and platforms that enable our work.

As part of our commitment to operational excellence and sustainable practices, this document outlines the responsibilities and expectations for using IT equipment and digital resources provided to you under contract with LLInformatics. Whether you are working with a leased MacBook, accessing shared cloud infrastructure, or managing sensitive communications, your awareness and habits directly impact data security, equipment longevity, and the company's overall efficiency.

The policy covers:

- **Hardware care**, including the nature of leased equipment and tips for avoiding costly repairs.
- **Email and communication practices**, emphasizing professionalism, privacy, and phishing prevention.
- **Basic cloud usage guidelines**, reinforcing secure access, permission hygiene, and responsible resource management across Google Workspace, GitHub, AWS, and more.

It is not just a rulebook—it’s a toolkit to help you avoid common pitfalls, protect company assets, and work smarter. Whether you’re a seasoned contractor or new to the team, this guide is designed to support a frictionless, secure, and professional work experience.

If you’re ever unsure about a situation, don’t guess—reach out to the Operations Team for guidance.
